# Nitro Nuker
> Remove all traces of Nitro ever being a thing from Discord

## Installation
1. Setup a development version of Vencord: [instructions](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/)
2. Clone package into src/userplugins
3. Run the installer with `pnpm inject` and install normally

Maybe this will get merged into the main repository if Vencord even allowed this. I don't see why they wouldn't especially since they allow plugins like Fake Nitro
